# 🔧 Docker Build Fixes - Cookies Manager CRM

This document explains the Docker build issues that were encountered and the fixes implemented.

## 🚨 Issues Identified

### 1. **Cache Path Error**

```
In Compiler.php line 75:
Please provide a valid cache path.
```

**Root Cause**: Laravel's `package:discover` command during Composer's post-autoload-dump event couldn't find the cache directories.

**Why It Happened**:

-   Cache directories were created but with incorrect permissions
-   Composer ran as `laravel` user but directories weren't properly accessible
-   Laravel tried to access cache paths that didn't exist or weren't writable

### 2. **Deprecated PHP Settings**

```
PHP Deprecated: PHP Startup: Use of mbstring.http_input is deprecated
PHP Deprecated: PHP Startup: Use of mbstring.http_output is deprecated
```

**Root Cause**: PHP 8.3 deprecated these mbstring settings that were still in the configuration files.

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Directory Creation and Permissions**

**Before (Problematic)**:

```dockerfile
RUN mkdir -p \
    storage/framework/{cache,sessions,views} \
    bootstrap/cache && \
    chown -R laravel:laravel storage bootstrap/cache && \
    chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
```

**After (Fixed)**:

```dockerfile
RUN mkdir -p \
    storage/app \
    storage/framework/cache \
    storage/framework/sessions \
    storage/framework/views \
    storage/logs \
    bootstrap/cache \
    /tmp/php_sessions \
    /tmp/opcache && \
    chown -R laravel:laravel storage bootstrap/cache /tmp/php_sessions /tmp/opcache && \
    chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache /tmp/php_sessions /tmp/opcache

# Set proper permissions for Composer to work
RUN chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
```

**What Changed**:

-   Explicitly created each directory instead of using brace expansion
-   Added missing directories (`storage/app`, `storage/logs`)
-   Added temporary directories for sessions and OPcache
-   Double-checked permissions before running Composer

### 2. **Added Temporary Environment File**

**New Addition**:

```dockerfile
# Create a temporary .env file for the build process
RUN echo "APP_ENV=production" > .env && \
    echo "APP_DEBUG=false" >> .env && \
    echo "APP_KEY=base64:$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env && \
    echo "CACHE_DRIVER=file" >> .env && \
    echo "SESSION_DRIVER=file" >> .env && \
    echo "QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync" >> .env && \
    echo "LOG_CHANNEL=stack" >> .env
```

**Why This Helps**:

-   Provides Laravel with essential configuration during build
-   Sets `CACHE_DRIVER=file` to avoid Redis dependency during build
-   Generates a valid `APP_KEY` for encryption operations
-   Ensures Laravel can run basic commands without errors

### 3. **Removed Deprecated PHP Settings**

**Before (Deprecated)**:

```ini
mbstring.http_input = "UTF-8"
mbstring.http_output = "UTF-8"
```

**After (Fixed)**:

```ini
; Note: mbstring.http_input and mbstring.http_output are deprecated in PHP 8.3+
; These settings are now handled automatically by PHP
```

**What Changed**:

-   Removed deprecated settings from `docker/prod/php.ini`
-   Removed deprecated settings from `docker/staging/php.ini`
-   Added explanatory comments about the deprecation

### 4. **Enhanced Build Testing**

**New Test Script**: `scripts/test-build.sh`

-   Tests Docker build process
-   Verifies container startup
-   Checks health endpoint functionality
-   Provides clear success/failure feedback

**New Make Target**: `make test-build`

-   Easy way to test the build process
-   Integrated with existing Makefile workflow

## 🧪 Testing the Fixes

### Test the Build Process

```bash
# Test the Docker build
make test-build

# Or run the script directly
./scripts/test-build.sh
```

### Test Environment Setup

```bash
# Test local environment
make dev

# Test staging environment
make staging-setup

# Test production environment
make prod-setup
```

## 🔍 What the Fixes Address

### 1. **Build Reliability**

-   ✅ Cache directories exist with proper permissions
-   ✅ Laravel has valid configuration during build
-   ✅ No more "valid cache path" errors

### 2. **PHP Compatibility**

-   ✅ No more deprecated setting warnings
-   ✅ PHP 8.3 compatible configurations
-   ✅ Clean build output

### 3. **Environment Consistency**

-   ✅ All environments (local, staging, production) work
-   ✅ Proper isolation between environments
-   ✅ Consistent directory structure

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Test the Build**

```bash
# Test the build process
make test-build
```

### 2. **Deploy to Staging**

```bash
# Test staging environment
make staging-setup
```

### 3. **Deploy to Production**

```bash
# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy.sh production
```

-   **Environment Templates**: `env.template`, `env.local.example`
-   **Makefile Commands**: `make help`
-   **Deployment Script**: `scripts/deploy.sh`

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

### Check Build Logs

```bash
# Build with verbose output
docker build --progress=plain -t test-image .

# Check specific stage
docker build --target production -t test-image .
```

### Verify Environment

```bash
# Check if environment files exist
ls -la .env*

# Verify Docker is running
docker info
```

### Common Debugging

```bash
# Check container logs
make logs

# Check service status
make status

# Check health endpoint
make health
```

**The fixes should resolve the build issues. If problems persist, the enhanced error handling and testing tools will help identify the root cause.**
